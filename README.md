Bayesian Data Analysis with PyMC3
=================================

Abstract
--------

Probabilistic Programming allows flexible specification of statistical models to gain insight from data. Estimation of best fitting parameter values, as well as uncertainty in these estimations, can be automated by sampling algorithms like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The high interpretability and flexibility of this approach has lead to a huge paradigm shift in scientific fields ranging from Cognitive Science to Data Science and Quantitative Finance.

PyMC3 is a new Python module that features next generation sampling algorithms and an intuitive model specification syntax. The whole code base is written in pure Python and Just-in-time compiled via Theano for speed.

In this talk I will provide an intuitive introduction to Bayesian statistics and how probabilistic models can be specified and estimated using PyMC3.

Dependencies
------------

Depending on what you already installed, you may need to take the
following steps:

1. On OS X, you may need to install MacTex from
   http://mirror.ctan.org/systems/mac/mactex/MacTeX.pkg
   
2. pip install brewer2mpl
   brew install git
   git clone https://github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib.git
   cd prettyplotlib/
   python setup.py install

3. pip install git+https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc

   [Currently](https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc/issues/483) needs
   correction for "except exceptions.KeyError" in
   ~/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/lib/python2.7/site-packages/pymc/plots.py

4. pip install patsy
   pip install statsmodels

5. pip install zipline
